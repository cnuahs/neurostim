classdef fixate  < neurostim.behaviors.eyeMovement
    % This state machine defines two new states:
    % FREEVEIWING - each trial starts here
    %              -> FIXATING when the eye moves inside the window
    %              ->FAIL  if t>t.from
    %               ->FAIL afterTrial
    % FIXATING    -> FAIL if eye moves outside the window before t.to
    %             -> SUCCESS if eye is still inside the window at or after t.to  
    %             ->SUUCCSS afterTrial
    % Note that **even before t< o.from**, the eye has to remain 
    % in the window once it is in there (no in-and-out privileges)
    % 
    %% Parameters (inherited from eyeMovement):
    % 
    % X,Y,  - fixation position 
    % tolerance - width/height of the square tolerance window around X,Y
    % invert - invert the definition : eye position outside the tolerance is
    %           considered good, inside is bad.
    %  allowBlinks  - ignore blinks.

        % events that signal that a state is about to begin (e.isEntry) or

        % some setup - most states don't have to do anything.
