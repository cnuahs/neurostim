classdef splittaskdemochild < neurostim.stimuli.splittasksacrossframes
    %Demo of using splittasksacrossframes to distribute tasks across frames
    %Costly tasks that take more than one frame to complete cause frame
    %drops, but can be split into sub-tasks to reduce or, if possible,
    %eliminate drops. Here, we don't actually use the computation results
    %for anything visually, just compile some lists of random numbers, but
    %it illustrates how to assign tasks, and deal with the sub-tasks that
    %they break into during optimisation.
    %If the calculations can be done within the o.bigFrameInterval, you
    %should see frame drops reduce across trials and ideally, disappear
    %entirely.
    %
    %See fastFilteredImageDemo and fastfilteredimage for another example.
