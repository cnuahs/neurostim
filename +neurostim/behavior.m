classdef (Abstract) behavior <  neurostim.plugin
    % This abstract class implements a finite state machine to
    % define behaviors. Derived classes are needed to implement specific
    % behavioral sequences. See for example behaviors.fixate or
    % behaviors.keyResponse.
    %
    % This base class only implements two states:
    % FAIL - the final state of the machine indicating that the behavioral
    %           constraints defined by the machine were not met.
    % SUCCESS - the final state of the machine indicating tha that the
    % behavioral constraints defined by the machine were met. 
    % 
    % Derived classes should define their states such that the machine ends
    % in either the FAIL or SUCCESS endstate.
    % To learn how to do this, look at the behaviors.fixate class which
    % implements one complete state machine for steady fixation in a trial.
    % Then look at behaviors.saccade and behaviors.fixateThenChoose to see 
    % how behaviors can build on each other. In all cases, if you find
    % yourself adding many if/then constructs to see where you are in the
    % flow of the behavior, then you're probably doing something wrong and
    % should think about adding a state instead. 
    % Another example of inheritance is the keyResponse (single key
    % press per trial) and multiKeyResponse (multiple presses that allow a
    % subject to change their mind during the trial). This could be
    % achieved by adding various flags and if/thens in the keyResponse
    % behavior, but adding states (as in multikeyResponse) leads to cleaner
    % and less error prone code.

    % Parameters:
    % failEndsTrial  - a trial ends when the FAIL state is reached [true]
    % successEndsTrial - a trial ends when the SUCCESS state is reached  [false]
    % verbose - Write output about each state change to the command line [true]
    % stateName - the name of the current state of the machine.
    % isOn -  Logical to indicate whether the machine is currently active.
    % stopTime - the trial time when the machine reached either the FAIL or
    %                   SUCCESS state in the current trial
    % required - If this is true, then this behaviors end state is used to
    % determine the success of an entire trail (which may have other
    % behaviors too) [true]
    % 
    % Functions to be used in experiment designs:
    % 
    % startTime(o,state) - returns the time in the current trial when the
    % specified state started. 
    % duration(o,state,t) - returns how long the machine has been in state s at time t
    %                       of the current trial (or the current time if t is not provide).
    %
    % 
    % 
    % TODO:
    %   hack str2fun so that it can accept f1.startTime.fixation instead of
    %   startTime(cic.f1,''fixation'') as is currently necessary because
    %   str2fun cannot handle the .startTime.fixation.
