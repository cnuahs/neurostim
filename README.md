This project wraps object oriented Matlab code around the basic graphics functionality of the [Psycophysics Toolbox](http://psychtoolbox.org/) to make 
experiments more reusable and reproducable. 


There is no user guide, but the demos folder shows how to setup experiments
and achieve certain common experimental goals:

Simple experimental design :
`behaviorDemo`

Using staircases, quest, or jittered parameters:
`adaptiveDemo`

Using calibrated CIE color
`xylDemo`


Using calibrated luminance 
`lumDemo`

Using high resolution devices (Bits++, ViewPixx)
`vpxDemo`
