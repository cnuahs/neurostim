# neurostim-ptb
Psychophysics Toolbox Variant of Neurostim

The goal of this Matlab project is to wrap code around the basic graphics functionality of the PTB to make 
experiments more reusable and reproducable. 


There is no user guide, but there are demos that show how to setup experiments
and how to achieve certain goals:

Simple experimental design :
behaviorDemo

Using staircases, quest, or jittered parameters:
adaptiveDemo

Using calibrated CIE color
xylDemo


Using calibrated luminance 
lumDemo

Using high resolution devices (Bits++, ViewPixx)
