This project wraps object oriented Matlab code around the basic graphics functionality of the [Psycophysics Toolbox](http://psychtoolbox.org/) to make 
experiments more reusable and reproducable. 


There is no user guide, but there are demos that show how to setup experiments
and how to achieve certain goals:

Simple experimental design :
behaviorDemo

Using staircases, quest, or jittered parameters:
adaptiveDemo

Using calibrated CIE color
xylDemo


Using calibrated luminance 
lumDemo

Using high resolution devices (Bits++, ViewPixx)
vpxDemo
